# Gurobipy-makespan-problem
Solving the makespan problem using Gurobi Solver in Python.<br>
As input we have:<br>
1. J = {j1,j2, .. jn} - tasks<br>
2. P = {p1,p2, .. pn} - time required to do each task<br>
3. M = {m1,m2,m3} - avielable machines.<br>

Goal:<br>
1. Arrange jobs so as to minimize the maximum processing time of all machines.<br>
